## 📄 Final Report

⚠️ As I will be competing this year, I’ve decided not to share my code or final results publicly. However, I’m sharing my notes to help others explore ARC-AGI.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project investigates the limitations of Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) in achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), with a focus on the ARC-AGI benchmark introduced by François Chollet. ARC-AGI is designed to test core human priors such as objectness, numerosity, and compositionality—fundamental capabilities where current LLMs often fall short, particularly in internalizing abstract representations or reasoning symbolically.

We introduce the first mathematical and intuitive framework for analyzing ARC-AGI, and survey state-of-the-art approaches aimed at overcoming these limitations, including test-time tuning (TTT) and inference-time strategies such as AIRV. Building on this foundation, we propose a classification-based architecture inspired by Gestalt psychology, defining 16 distinct human "perceptions" essential for solving ARC-AGI tasks.

Using Hodel's DSL generator and random combinations of up to three transformations, we expand the classification dataset to over 1.2 million examples and develop an initial neural classification model. Our early findings suggest that solving ARC-AGI may require a two-level cognitive process. We also raise key questions about how LLMs perceive structured reasoning tasks relative to human intuition.

Ultimately, we argue that abstraction in language models may require mechanisms akin to the quotient operator in mathematics, and we propose future directions inspired by DreamCoder-style neural program induction.

> I believe that anyone wishing to venture down this path will have to define a new field of mathematics—one that redefines what information is, and the kinds of transformations that preserve it. This new framework may intersect with ideas from physical entropy in physics and informational entropy in computer science. Such a foundation could help explain how intelligent systems represent, compress, and reason about structure, and why current models fall short.
